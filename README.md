### Asteroid diameter prediction using machine learning models - case study on a kaggle [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/basu369victor/prediction-of-asteroid-diameter).
This repository holds our 2023 Artificial Intelligence class project, which managed to earn us 3rd place in an Amazon Earn and Learn competition.

We have managed to study and classify 7 distinct ML models, which were trained on a NASA dataset of known asteroids. Using 88 selected features such as orbit parameters and captured image properties, we have trained the following models:
1. MLP-NN
2. C-NN
3. SVM
4. AdaBoost
5. K-NN (uniform)
6. K-NN (distance)
7. Random Forest

After analysing the results based on different metrics, it was clear that the Random Forest model had the best immediate results. However, we are firmly convinced that with careful hyperparameter tweaking, we can achieve better results using a Neural Network model.

For a digest of our results, refer to our [presentation](https://github.com/RaduStefan999/AI-2022-AsteroidsProject/blob/main/presentation_ro.pdf) (available only in romanian as of the time of this commit).
